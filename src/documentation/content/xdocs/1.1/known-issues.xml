  <known-issue>
    Support for Unicode characters outside of the Base Multilingual Plane (BMP), i.e., characters
    whose code points are greater than 65535, is not yet implemented.
    See <link href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51843">bug 51843</link>.
  </known-issue>
  <known-issue>
    The writing-mode property does not produce the expected behavior when specified on
    <code>fo:simple-page-master</code>  or <code>fo:region-*</code> elements.
    See <link href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53276">bug 53276</link>.

  <known-issue>
    Support for Devanagari and other Indic scripts is not yet complete.
  </known-issue>
  <known-issue>
    Use of Unicode U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER (ZWNJ) or U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER (ZWJ)
    does not prevent or force contextual substitution, respectively, when used with Arabic script.
  </known-issue>
  <known-issue>
    Use of Unicode U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER (ZWNJ) or U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER (ZWJ)
    does not affect conjunct formation or other special behavior prescribed when used with Indic scripts.
  </known-issue>
  <known-issue>
    Support for automatic line breaking at orthographic syllable segment boundaries in Indic
    or Southeast Asian scripts is not yet available. In the mean time, use U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE (ZWSP).
  </known-issue>
  <known-issue>
    Complex script content is presently supported only with AT, IF, and PDF output formats.
  </known-issue>
  <known-issue>
    When complex script text encounters an  <code>fo:inline</code> or <code>fo:character</code> boundary,
    contextual substitution and ligature formation will not occur across the boundary. This prevents,
    for example, applying a different color to an Arabic Letter within an Arabic word, unless that letter
    is a non-joining letter (on both sides).
