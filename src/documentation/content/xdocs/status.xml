      <p>Last updated 20 October 2012.</p>
      <p>
        Apache™ FOP Version 1.1 was released on 20 October 2012.
      </p>

      <title>Development Status</title>
      <p>
        The FOP code base is gradually evolving, from Version 0.90,
	released on 22 November 2005, to Version 1.1, released on
        20 October 2012. Further releases in the 1.x series and beyond are expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        FOP releases prior to version 0.90 were based on a different
	code base. The last release in that series was version 0.20.5,
	released on 18 July 2003. This earlier series is no longer maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are looking for future release dates, keep in mind that FOP is an Open
        Source project and we're a combination of volunteers (working in our free time) and
        sponsored contributors (generally focusing on our sponsor's needs). What we have        
        is an idea where we want to go. How fast we get there depends on the 
        available time, on how well our ideas work out while developing and on you!
        There's a <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/xmlgraphics-fop/RoadMap">document in the Wiki</a>
        where ideas for new developments may be registered and documented.
